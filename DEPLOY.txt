Some notes on deploying as a web service.

1) Install nginx

   Easiest I found was simply 'brew install nginx'

2) Install uwsgi

   This was a pain on Big Sur. Here's what worked:

   conda install clang
   export CFLAGS="-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.3.sdk/usr/include"
   export LDFLAGS="-L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.3.sdk/usr/lib -iframework /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.3.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks"

   pip install uwsgi

3) run deploy.sh in this folder

4) run start.sh/stop.sh
