Here are some custom tools developed by Chris Burns, specifically to help
with operating the telescopes at <a href='https://mtwilson.edu'>
Mount Wilson Observatory</a>.</P>

   <LI><h3><a href="navigator/">The Interactive Nicholson List</a></h3>
       This tool
       gives both a spreadsheet-like list of currently visible objects
       as well as visual representation of the sky. Best viewed with a
       browser window at least 1400 pixels wide (or you can scale it down
       using your browser's controls).</LI>
   <LI><h3><a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1InFeGjT49p_HtvLEVNgQ4355sj8c_4hS5B_wVZ03hHk/edit?usp=sharing'>Birthday/Anniversary Star Finder</a></h3>
       This is a google spreadsheet with all visible (V>12) stars within 
       100 ly of the
       Earth. It is sorted by distance (in ly), so hopefully easy to find
       a star that matches a specific year. It is shared read-only, so can
       be viewed, but if you want to filter and/or sort the data, you will
       need to make a copy to your own google account.
